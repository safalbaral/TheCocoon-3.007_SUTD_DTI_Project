# The Cocoon

As part of SUTD's 2023 run of its 3.007 course, we built The Cocoon.
It is a reimagining of a space in Changi Business Park, Singapore, whcih transforms it into an ideal place for relaxation.

## Building The Cocoon
* A physical scaled down fully functioning model of the new design was built, with lights, sensors, and motors controlled with Raspberry Pi Pico W connected to a backend, with commands sent through a React frontend.
* 3D printed parts were used for the model.
* A 3D render of the new site was also created and edited into a demonstration video.
